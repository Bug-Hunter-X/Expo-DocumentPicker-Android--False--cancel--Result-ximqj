This bug occurs when using the Expo DocumentPicker API on Android.  The issue is that the `DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync` method sometimes returns a result with a `type` of `"cancel"`, even when the user has actually selected a file. This leads to unexpected behavior in the application, as the code might handle a cancellation incorrectly, assuming the user did not choose a file when they actually did.
